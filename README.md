Project Description:  
https://wiki.tum.de/display/infar/MA%3A+A+Gamified+Drinking+Reminder+Application+for+Seniors


The project was developed in such a way that the game or parts of it could easily be added to a pre-existing "Game-Collection"-App previously developed at the Chair.

The profile management and interaction with a bluetooth drinking gadget were adapted from previous works.

In order to make the GitHub project public, the Bluetooth function was removed, as it contained paid assets.
